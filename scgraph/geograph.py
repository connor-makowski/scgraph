                    - `origin`: The id of the origin node from the graph dictionary to start the shortest path from

            - What: The circuity factor to apply to any distance calculations between your origin and destination nodes and their connecting nodes in the graph
            - Default: 1
            - Notes:
                - For alogrithmic solving purposes, the node_addition_circuity is applied to the origin and destination nodes when they are added to the graph
                - This is only applied after an `optimal solution` using the `node_addition_circuity` has been found when it is then adjusted to equal the `off_graph_circuity`
        - `node_addition_type`
            - Type: str
            - What: The type of node addition to use when adding your origin node to the distance matrix
            - Default: 'kdclosest' (was 'quadrant' prior to v2.10.0)
            - Options:
                - 'kdclosest': Add the closest node using a KD-Tree
                - 'quadrant': Add the closest node in each quadrant (ne, nw, se, sw) to the distance matrix for this node
                - 'closest': Add only the closest node to the distance matrix for this node
                - 'all': Add all nodes to the distance matrix for this node
            - Notes:
                - 'closest' is the recommended option for most use cases due to speed and accuracy
                    - Using 'closest' adds about 20 microseconds to the algorithm runtime for graphs like scgraph_data.world_highways
                    - Using 'quadrant' adds about 80 milliseconds to the algorithm runtime for graphs like scgraph_data.world_highways
                    - Using 'all' adds about 80 milliseconds to the algorithm runtime for graphs like scgraph_data.world_highways
                - The destination node is always added as 'all' regardless of the `node_addition_type` setting
                    - This guarantees that any destination node will be connected to any origin node regardless of how or where the origin node is added to the graph
                - If the passed graph is not a connected graph (meaning it is comprised of multiple disconnected networks)
                    - The entrypoints generated using the `node_addition_type` will determine which disconnected networks will be used to calculate the `optimal route`
        - `node_addition_circuity`
            - Type: int | float
            - What: The circuity factor to apply when adding your origin and destination nodes to the distance matrix
            - Default: 4
            - Note:
                - This defaults to 4 to prevent the algorithm from taking a direct route in direction of the destination over some impassible terrain (EG: a maritime network that goes through land)
                - A higher value will push the algorithm to join the network at a closer node to avoid the extra distance from the circuity factor
                - This is only relevant if `node_addition_type` is set to 'quadrant' or 'all' as it affects the choice on where to enter the graph network
                - This factor is used to calculate the node sequence for the `optimal route`, however the reported `length` of the path will be calculated using the `off_graph_circuity` factor
        - `geograph_units`
            - Type: str
            - What: The units of measurement in the geograph data
            - Default: 'km'
            - Options:
                - 'km': Kilometers
                - 'm': Meters
                - 'mi': Miles
                - 'ft': Feet
            - Note: In general, all scgraph provided geographs be in kilometers
        - `output_coordinate_path`
            - Type: str
            - What: The format of the output coordinate path
            - Default: 'list_of_lists'
            - Options:
                - 'list_of_dicts': A list of dictionaries with keys 'latitude' and 'longitude'
                - 'list_of_lists': A list of lists with the first value being latitude and the second being longitude
                - 'list_of_lists_long_first': A list of lists with the first value being longitude and the second being latitude
        - `output_path`
            - Type: bool
            - What: Whether to output the path as a list of geograph node ids (for debugging and other advanced uses)
            - Default: False
        - `node_addition_lat_lon_bound`
            - Type: int | float | Literal["auto"]
            - What: Forms a bounding box around the origin and destination nodes as they are added to graph
                - Only points on the current graph inside of this bounding box are considered when updating the distance matrix for the origin or destination nodes
            - Default: 'auto'
            - If set to 'auto', the bounding box is set based on the distance between the origin and destination nodes capped at `auto_lat_lon_bound_max` for the origin node
            - Note: If no nodes are found within the bounding box, the bounding box is expanded to 180 degrees in all directions (all nodes are considered)
            - Note: This is only used when adding a new node (the specified origin and destination) to the graph
        - `auto_lat_lon_bound_max`
            - Type: int | float
            - What: The maximum value for the automatic latitude/longitude bounding box used only for the origin node when `node_addition_lat_lon_bound` is set to 'auto'
            - Default: 2
            - Note: Only used if `node_addition_lat_lon_bound` is set to 'auto'
        - `node_addition_math`
            - Type: str
            - What: The math to use when calculating the distance between nodes when determining the closest node (or closest quadrant node) to add to the graph
            - Default: 'euclidean'
            - Options:
                - 'euclidean': Use the euclidean distance between nodes. This is much faster but is not as accurate (especially near the poles)
                - 'haversine': Use the haversine distance between nodes. This is slower but is an accurate representation of the surface distance between two points on the earth
            - Notes:
                - Only used if `node_addition_type` is set to 'quadrant' or 'closest'
        - `destination_node_addition_type`
            - Type: str
            - What: The method to use when adding the destination node to the graph
            - Default: 'kdclosest' (was 'all' in functionality prior to v2.10.0)
            - Options:
                - 'kdclosest': Add the closest node using a KD-Tree
                - 'closest': Add the node to the closest point in the graph
                - 'quadrant': Add the node to the quadrant it belongs to
                - 'all': Add the node to all points in the graph
            - Notes:
                - If your graph is not fully connected, and you try a route that cannot work:
                    - The algorithm will remove the destination node and try again with the destination node added as 'all'
        - `silent`
            - Type: bool
            - What: If True, suppresses all output from the function
            - Default: False
        - `**kwargs`
            - Additional keyword arguments. These are included for forwards and backwards compatibility reasons, but are not currently used.

    Function:

    - Create a CustomGeoGraph object loaded from a geojson file

    Required Arguments:

            - The geojson file must be a FeatureCollection

                - Origin and destination node idxs must be integers between 0 and n-1 where n is the number of nodes in the graph
