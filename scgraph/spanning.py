class SpanningTree:

    def makowskis_spanning_tree(graph: list[dict], node_id: int) -> dict:
        """
        Function:

        - Calculate the spanning tree of a graph using Makowski's modified Dijkstra algorithm
            - Modifications allow for a sparse distance matrix to be used instead of a dense distance matrix
            - Improvements include only computing future potential nodes based on the open leaves for each branch
                - Open leaves are nodes that have not been visited yet but are adjacent to other visited nodes
            - This can dramatically reduce the memory and compute requirements of the algorithm
            - For particularly sparse graphs, this algorithm runs close to O(n log n) time
                - Where n is the number of nodes in the graph
            - For dense graphs, this algorithm runs closer to O(n^2) time (similar to the standard Dijkstra algorithm)
                - Where n is the number of nodes in the graph

        Required Arguments:

        - `graph`:
            - Type: list of dictionaries
            - See: https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html#GeoGraph
        - `node_id`
            - Type: int
            - What: The id of the node from which to calculate the spanning tree

        Returns:

        - A dictionary with the following keys:
            - `node_id`: The id of the node from which the spanning tree was calculated
            - `predecessors`: A list of node ids referring to the predecessor of each node given the spanning tree
                - Note: For disconnected graphs, nodes that are not connected to the origin node will have a predecessor of None
            - `distance_matrix`: A list of distances from the origin node to each node in the graph
                - Note: For disconnected graphs, nodes that are not connected to the origin node will have a distance of float("inf")
