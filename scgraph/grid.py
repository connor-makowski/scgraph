        Initializes a GridGraph object.

        Required Arguments:

        - `x_size`
            - Type: int
            - What: The size of the grid in the x direction
        - `y_size`
            - Type: int
            - What: The size of the grid in the y direction
        - `blocks`
            - Type: list of tuples
            - What: A list of tuples representing the coordinates of the blocked cells

        Optional Arguments:

        - `shape`
            - Type: list of tuples
            - What: A list of tuples representing the shape of the moving object relative to the object location in the grid
            - Default: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
            - Example: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
                - Note: This would form a square of size 1x1
                - Assuming the grid location is at (0,0) the square takes up the grid space between (0, 0) and (1, 1)
                - Assumint the grid location is at (1,1) the square takes up the grid space between (1, 1) and (2, 2) with the same shape
            - Note: This shape is used to determine which connections are allowed when passing through the grid.
                - For example
                    - The shape is a square of size 1x1
                    - The location of the square is (0, 0)
                    - There is a blocked cell at (0, 1)
                    - There is a potential connection to (1, 1), (0, 1), and (1, 0)
                    - The square can not move to (1, 1) as it would collide with the blocked cell at (0, 1)
                      - This is because the square would pass partly through the blocked cell on its way to (1, 1)
                      - To achieve the same result, it can move to (1, 0) and then up to (1, 1) taking extra time / distance
        - `add_exterior_walls`
            - Type: bool
            - What: Whether to add exterior walls to the grid
            - Default: True
        - `conn_data`
            - Type: list of tuples
            - What: A list of tuples representing movements allowed in the grid
                - Each tuple should contain three values: (x_offset, y_offset, distance)
                - x_offset: The x offset from the current cell
                - y_offset: The y offset from the current cell
                - distance: The distance to the connected cell
            - Default: [(0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (0, -1, 1), (-1, 0, 1), (1, 1, sqrt(2)), (-1, -1, sqrt(2)), (1, -1, sqrt(2)), (-1, 1, sqrt(2))]
                - Note: If None, the default connection data will be used
                - Note: This includes 8 directions, 4 cardinal and 4 diagonal
                - Cardinal directions are 1 unit away, diagonal directions are sqrt(2) units away
