## Documentation

Getting Started: https://github.com/connor-makowski/scgraph

Low Level: https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html


## Key Features

- Calculate the shortest path between two points on earth using a latitude / longitude pair
    - Inputs:
        - A latitude / longitude pair for the origin
        - A latitude / longitude pair for the destination
    - Calculation:
        - Algorithms:
            - Dijkstra's algorithm (Modified for sparse networks)
                - Modified to support sparse network data structures
            - Makowski's Modified Sparse Dijkstra algorithm
                - Modified for O(n) performance on particularly sparse networks
            - Possible future support for other algorithms
        - Distances:
            - Uses the [haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate the distance between two points on earth
    - Returns:
        - `path`:
            - A list of dictionaries (`latitude` and `longitude`) that make up the shortest path
        - `length`:
            - The distance in kilometers between the two points
- Antimeridian support
- Arbitrary start and end points
- Arbitrary network data sets
- Grid based graphs
- Cached shortest path calculations for very fast repetative calculations to or from the same point in a graph.
    - Note: Geographs are not yet supported for this feature


## Setup

Make sure you have Python 3.10.x (or higher) installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Note: Support for python3.6-python3.9 is available up to version 2.2.0.

## Installation

```
pip install scgraph
```

## Use with Google Colab

# Getting Started

## Basic Usage

Get the shortest path between two points on earth using a latitude / longitude pair
In this case, calculate the shortest maritime path between Shanghai, China and Savannah, Georgia, USA.

```py
# Use a maritime network geograph
from scgraph.geographs.marnet import marnet_geograph

# Get the shortest path between
output = marnet_geograph.get_shortest_path(
    origin_node={"latitude": 31.23,"longitude": 121.47},
    destination_node={"latitude": 32.08,"longitude": -81.09},
    output_units='km'
)
print('Length: ',output['length']) #=> Length:  19596.4653
```

In the above example, the `output` variable is a dictionary with three keys: `length` and `coordinate_path`.

- `length`: The distance between the passed origin and destination when traversing the graph along the shortest path
    - Notes:
        - This will be in the units specified by the `output_units` parameter.
        - `output_units` options:
            - `km` (kilometers - default)
            - `m` (meters)
            - `mi` (miles)
            - `ft` (feet)
- `coordinate_path`: A list of lists [`latitude`,`longitude`] that make up the shortest path

For more examples including viewing the output on a map, see the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/connor-makowski/scgraph/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb).

## GridGraph usage

Example:
- Create a grid of 20x100 cells.
    - This creates a grid based graph with connections to all 8 neighbors for each grid item.
    - Each grid item has 4 cardinal connections at length 1 and 4 diagonal connections at length sqrt(2)
- Create a wall from (10,5) to (10,99).
    - This would foce any path to go to the bottom of the graph to get around the wall.
- Get the shortest path between (2,10) and (18,10)
    - Note: The length of this path should be 16 without the wall and 20.9704 with the wall.

```py
from scgraph import GridGraph

x_size = 20
y_size = 20
blocks = [(10, i) for i in range(5, y_size)]

# Create the GridGraph object
gridGraph = GridGraph(
    x_size=x_size,
    y_size=y_size,
    blocks=blocks,
    add_exterior_walls=True,
)

# Solve the shortest path between two points
output = gridGraph.get_shortest_path(
    origin_node={"x": 2, "y": 10},
    destination_node={"x": 18, "y": 10},
    # Optional: Specify the output coodinate format (default is 'list_of_dicts)
    output_coordinate_path="list_of_lists",
    # Optional: Cache the origin point spanning_tree for faster calculations on future calls
    cache=True,
    # Optional: Specify the node to cache the spanning tree for (default is the origin node)
    # Note: This first call will be slower, but future calls using this origin node will be substantially faster
    cache_for="origin",
)

print(output)
#=> {'length': 20.9704, 'coordinate_path': [[2, 10], [3, 9], [4, 8], [5, 8], [6, 7], [7, 6], [8, 5], [9, 4], [10, 4], [11, 4], [12, 5], [13, 6], [14, 7], [15, 7], [16, 8], [17, 9], [18, 10]]}
```

## Advanced Usage

Using `scgraph_data` geographs:
- Note: Make sure to install the `scgraph_data` package before using these geographs
```py
from scgraph_data.world_railways import world_railways_geograph

# Get the shortest path between Kalamazoo Michigan and Detroit Michigan by Train
output = world_railways_geograph.get_shortest_path(
    origin_node={"latitude": 42.29,"longitude": -85.58},
    destination_node={"latitude": 42.33,"longitude": -83.05}
)
```

Get a geojson line path of an output for easy visualization:
- Note: `mapshaper.org` and `geojson.io` are good tools for visualizing geojson files
```py
from scgraph.geographs.marnet import marnet_geograph
from scgraph.utils import get_line_path

 # Get the shortest sea path between Sri Lanka and Somalia
output = marnet_geograph.get_shortest_path(
    origin_node={"latitude": 7.87,"longitude": 80.77},
    destination_node={"latitude": 5.15,"longitude": 46.20}
)
# Write the output to a geojson file
get_line_path(output, filename='output.geojson')
```

Modify an existing geograph: See the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/connor-makowski/scgraph/blob/main/examples/geograph_modifications.ipynb)


You can specify your own custom graphs for direct access to the solving algorithms. This requires the use of the low level `Graph` class

```py
from scgraph import Graph

# Define an arbitrary graph
# See the graph definitions here:
# https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html#GeoGraph
graph = [
    {1: 5, 2: 1},
    {0: 5, 2: 2, 3: 1},
    {0: 1, 1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 8},
    {1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 3, 5: 6},
    {2: 8, 3: 3},
    {3: 6}
]

# Optional: Validate your graph
Graph.validate_graph(graph=graph)

# Get the shortest path between idx 0 and idx 5
output = Graph.dijkstra_makowski(graph=graph, origin_id=0, destination_id=5)
#=> {'path': [0, 2, 1, 3, 5], 'length': 10}
```

You can also use a slightly higher level `GeoGraph` class to work with latitude / longitude pairs

```py
from scgraph import GeoGraph

# Define nodes
# See the nodes definitions here:
# https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html#GeoGraph
nodes = [
    # London
    [51.5074, -0.1278],
    # Paris
    [48.8566, 2.3522],
    # Berlin
    [52.5200, 13.4050],
    # Rome
    [41.9028, 12.4964],
    # Madrid
    [40.4168, -3.7038],
    # Lisbon
    [38.7223, -9.1393]
]
# Define a graph
# See the graph definitions here:
# https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html#GeoGraph
graph = [
    # From London
    {
        # To Paris
        1: 311,
    },
    # From Paris
    {
        # To London
        0: 311,
        # To Berlin
        2: 878,
        # To Rome
        3: 1439,
        # To Madrid
        4: 1053
    },
    # From Berlin
    {
        # To Paris
        1: 878,
        # To Rome
        3: 1181,
    },
    # From Rome
    {
        # To Paris
        1: 1439,
        # To Berlin
        2: 1181,
    },
    # From Madrid
    {
        # To Paris
        1: 1053,
        # To Lisbon
        5: 623
    },
    # From Lisbon
    {
        # To Madrid
        4: 623
    }
]

# Create a GeoGraph object
my_geograph = GeoGraph(nodes=nodes, graph=graph)

# Optional: Validate your graph
my_geograph.validate_graph()

# Optional: Validate your nodes
my_geograph.validate_nodes()

# Get the shortest path between two points
# In this case, Birmingham England and Zaragoza Spain
# Since Birmingham and Zaragoza are not in the graph,
# the algorithm will add them into the graph.
# See: https://connor-makowski.github.io/scgraph/scgraph/core.html#GeoGraph.get_shortest_path
# Expected output would be to go from
# Birmingham -> London -> Paris -> Madrid -> Zaragoza

output = my_geograph.get_shortest_path(
    # Birmingham England
    origin_node = {'latitude': 52.4862, 'longitude': -1.8904},
    # Zaragoza Spain
    destination_node = {'latitude': 41.6488, 'longitude': -0.8891}
)
print(output)
# {
#     'length': 1799.4323,
#     'coordinate_path': [
#         [52.4862, -1.8904],
#         [51.5074, -0.1278],
#         [48.8566, 2.3522],
#         [40.4168, -3.7038],
#         [41.6488, -0.8891]
#     ]
# }

```
